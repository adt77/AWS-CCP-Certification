Serverless computing 
The term “serverless” means that your code runs on servers, but you do not need to provision or manage these servers. With serverless computing, you can focus more on innovating new products and features instead of maintaining servers.
An AWS service for serverless computing is AWS Lambda.
AWS Lambda is a service that lets you run code without needing to provision or manage servers. 
While using AWS Lambda, you pay only for the compute time that you consume. Charges apply only when your code is running. You can also run code for virtually any type of application or backend service, all with zero administration. 
Container orchestration services help you to deploy, manage, and scale your containerized applications

Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)
 is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. 
Amazon ECS supports Docker containers. Docker is a software platform that enables you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. AWS supports the use of open-source Docker Community Edition and subscription-based Docker Enterprise Edition. With Amazon ECS, you can use API calls to launch and stop Docker-enabled applications.


Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS):-
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a fully managed service that you can use to run Kubernetes on AWS. 
Kubernetes is open-source software that enables you to deploy and manage containerized applications at scale. A large community of volunteers maintains Kubernetes, and AWS actively works together with the Kubernetes community.
Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, high-performance container management system that enables you to run and scale containerized applications on AWS. 


AWS Fargate:--
AWS Fargate is a serverless compute engine for containers. It works with both Amazon ECS and Amazon EKS. 
When using AWS Fargate, you do not need to provision or manage servers. AWS Fargate manages your server infrastructure for you. You can focus more on innovating and developing your applications, and you pay only for the resources that are required to run your containers.
